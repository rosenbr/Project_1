# Chefly Website
## Reverse-Engineered the Webite Yummly
### https://www.yummly.com/
### *Developed by Richard Rosenberg and Robin Weitzman*
## Project Descrition
Richard and Robin set-out to recreate some of the major features of the website Yummly. Their purpose was to mimic basic visual and functional features of the website. They created their website, naming it Chefly. 
## User Story
<p>Upon arrival to the landing page, the user will see a side nagivation bar/task menu, a horizontal search bar at the top of the page, and the rest of the page will be populated with a grid pattern of pictures of recipes, each will link to their own individual recipe page, and the user will be able to create a user account through a button on the side scroll bar, all features present on the Yummly website. 
<p>Richard an Robin decided to take away the first initial promt portion on the Yummly page, which is asking the user to select their favorite cuisines - Richard and Robin chose to do this because they felt it would create a better user experience with the initial impression NOT being geared towars prompting the uset to select caterogires before scrolling, and instead, simply just  displaying the recipes and their respective pictures.
